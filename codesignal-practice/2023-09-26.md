# Question 1

You are given two strings - `pattern` and `source`. The first string `pattern` contains only the symbols 0 and 1, and the second string source contains only lowercase English letters.

Let’s say that `pattern` matches a substring `source[1..r]` of source if the following three conditions are met:
* They have equal length,
* For each `0` in `pattern`, the corresponding letter in the substring is a vowel,
* For each `1` in `pattern`, the corresponding letter is a consonant

Your task is to calculate the number of substrings of `source` that match `pattern`.

Note: In this task we define the vowels as `a, e, i, o, u, y`. All other letters are consonants.

Example:

For `pattern = “010”` and `source = “amazing”`, the output should be `2`. 

```
a m a z i n g

0 1 0

    0 1 0
```


## Submitted Solution (500/500)

```python
def is_vowel(char, vowels):
  return char in vowels

def characters_match(pattern, source, p_index, s_index, vowels):
  return (pattern[p_index] == '0' and is_vowel(source[s_index], vowels)) or \
  (pattern[p_index] == '1' and not is_vowel(source[s_index], vowels))

def solution(pattern, source):
  vowels = set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y'])
  matches = 0

  # for each alphabet
  for i in range(len(source) - len(pattern) + 1):
  # can a substring start
  if characters_match(pattern, source, 0, i, vowels):
    # does a substring match the pattern
    match = True
    # check the next len(pattern) characters
    for j in range(0, len(pattern)):
      # if there is a mismatch, note that and exit
      if not characters_match(pattern, source, j, i+j, vowels):
        match = False
        break
      # if no mismatch, then increase the counter
      if match:
        matches += 1
  return matches
```
