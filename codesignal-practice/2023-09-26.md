# Question 1

You are given two strings - `pattern` and `source`. The first string `pattern` contains only the symbols 0 and 1, and the second string source contains only lowercase English letters.

Let’s say that `pattern` matches a substring `source[1..r]` of source if the following three conditions are met:
* They have equal length,
* For each `0` in `pattern`, the corresponding letter in the substring is a vowel,
* For each `1` in `pattern`, the corresponding letter is a consonant

Your task is to calculate the number of substrings of `source` that match `pattern`.

Note: In this task we define the vowels as `a, e, i, o, u, y`. All other letters are consonants.

Example:

For `pattern = “010”` and `source = “amazing”`, the output should be `2`. 

```
a m a z i n g

0 1 0

    0 1 0
```

```python
def is_vowel(char, vowels):
  return char in vowels

def characters_match(pattern, source, p_index, s_index, vowels):
  return (pattern[p_index] == '0' and is_vowel(source[s_index], vowels)) or \
  (pattern[p_index] == '1' and not is_vowel(source[s_index], vowels))

def solution(pattern, source):
  vowels = set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y'])
  matches = 0

  # for each alphabet
  for i in range(len(source) - len(pattern) + 1):
  # can a substring start
  if characters_match(pattern, source, 0, i, vowels):
    # does a substring match the pattern
    match = True
    # check the next len(pattern) characters
    for j in range(0, len(pattern)):
      # if there is a mismatch, note that and exit
      if not characters_match(pattern, source, j, i+j, vowels):
        match = False
        break
      # if no mismatch, then increase the counter
      if match:
        matches += 1
  return matches
```

# Question 2

Given an array os integers `a`, your task is to find how many of its contiguous subarrays of length `m` contain a pair of integers with a sum equal to `k`.

More formally, given the array `a`, your task is to count the number of indices `0 <= i <= a.length - m` such that a subarray `[a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[i + m - 1]]` contains at least one pair `(a[s], a[t])` where:

* `a != t`
* `a[a] + a[t] = k`

Example

For `a = [2, 4, 7, 5, 3, 5, 8, 5, 1, 7]`, `m=4`, and `k=10`, the output should be `solution(a, m, k) = 5`:

* Subarray a[1...4] = [4, 7, 5, 3] contains a[2] + a[4] = 7 + 3 = 10
* Subarray a[2..5] = [7, 5, 3, 5] contains two pairs, let's take one, a[2] + a[4] = 7 + 3 + 10
* Subarray a[3...6] = [5, 3, 5, 8] contains a[3] + a[5] = 5 + 5 = 10
* Subarray a[4...7] = [3, 5, 8, 5] contains a[5] + a[7] = 5 + 5 = 10
* Subarray a[5...8] = [5, 8, 5, 1] contains a[5] + a[7] = 5 + 5 = 10
