# Question 1

Given an array of integers a, your task is to calculate the digits that occur the most number of times in the array. Return the array of these digits in ascending order.

Example:

For `a = [25, 2, 3, 57, 38, 41]`, the output should be solution(a) = [2, 3, 5].

Here are the number of times each digit appears in the array:
```
0 -> 0
1 -> 1
2 -> 2
3 -> 2
4 -> 1
5 -> 2
6 -> 0
7 -> 1
8 -> 1
```

The most number of times any number occurs in the array is `2`, and the digits which appear `2` times are `2, 3 and 5`. So the answer is `[2, 3, 5]`.

Input/Output

* [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

* [memory limit] 1 GB

* [input] array.integer a

An array of positive integers.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ a.length ≤ 103,
1 ≤ a[i] < 100.

* [output] array.integer

The array of most frequently occurring digits, sorted in ascending order.

    digits = []
    while num:
        r_digit = num%10
        digits.append(r_digit)
        num //= 10
    return digits

def solution(a):
    # sum of number of digits all numbers
    total_digits = 0

    # freq_map[digit] = how many times does digit appear in total
    freq_map = defaultdict(int)
    
    for num in a:
        # get digits from the number
        digits = get_digits(num)
        # total number of digits are updated
        total_digits += len(digits)
        for digit in digits:
            freq_map[digit] += 1

    # freq_arr[i] = list of digits that appear i times
    freq_arr = [[] for _ in range(total_digits + 1)]
    for digit, freq in freq_map.items():
        freq_arr[freq].append(digit)

    # loop from the end, find a non-empty index, sort and return the digits
    for i in range(len(freq_arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        digits = freq_arr[i]
        if digits:
            digits.sort()
            return digits

# Question 2

A sawtooth sequence is a sequence of numbers that alternate between increasing and decreasing. In other words, each element is either strictly greater than its neighbouring elements or strictly less than its neighbouring elements.

Given an array of integers `arr`, your task is to count the number of contiguous subarrays that represent a sawtooth sequence of at least two elements.

Example:

* For `arr = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5]`, the output should be `solution(arr) = 4`.

  Since all the elements are arranged in decreasing order, it won't be possible to form any sawtooth subarrays of length `3` or more. There are `4` possible subarrays containing two elements, so the answer is `4`.

* For arr = `[10, 10, 10]`, the output should be `solution(arr) = 0`.

  Since all of the elements are equal, none of subarrays can be sawtooth, so the answer is `0`.

* For `arr = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the output should be `solution(arr) = 10`.

  All contiguous subarrays containing at least two elements satisfy the condition of problem. There are 10 possible contiguous subarrays containing at least two elements, so the answer is 10.
